                    <p>1. SSD Scheme was introduced in Nov 1978 with the aim of safeguarding the interest of widows and minor children and ensuring security of their deposits.</p>
                    <p>2. Under the scheme, AGIF benefits of widows or minor children of deceased personnel are invested by the AGIF in Nationalised Banks in cumulative or non-cumulative deposits, to the extent of amount and period stipulated by the member in his nomination. A widow can also opt for the scheme at the time of disbursement of benefits if the husband has not specified in the Nomination form.</p>
                    <p>3. For minor children, the amount is invested till they attain the age of majority, and in case of widows, for a period of one to five years, as indicated by the member in the Nomination form or as opted by the widow.</p>
