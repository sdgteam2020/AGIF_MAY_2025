                        for deduction of AGI monthly subscription and maintaining IRLA of Officers and JCOs & OR. However, in case of personnel
                        and Officers on secondment to establishments who are not being paid by the MoD and paid by respective Ministry, it becomes
                        obligatory on their part to ensure that AGI monthly subscription is remitted to respective Controller of Defence Accounts or
                        directly to AGIF. There have been instances in the past, wherein at the time of superannuation, there is an ambiguity in the
                        amount contributed by the Officer/ JCOs & OR while on secondment to such establishments not under the MoD. This has resulted in
                        avoidable delay in the payment of AGI maturity benefits. To prevent such delays, personnel on secondment to such establishment,
                        need to ensure and monitor timely remittance of AGI monthly subscription to respective Principal Controller of Defence Accounts
                        (Officers) Pune. Alternatively, Officers may remit the monthly AGI subscription direct to AGIF annually/bi-annually depending on
                        the duration of tenure in such establishment.
