                        All Army personnel are under AGIF insurance cover during their service period, which is a group insurance scheme. However, the insurance cover ceases after retirement
                        / discharge. Extended Army Insurance Scheme, which is also a group insurance, was started in 1981 against death for a specified period / prescribed age, whichever is earlier, for personnel retiring from service.
                        A single premium, at the rate decided from time to time by BOG, is retained out of the maturity benefit amount payable at the time of retirement / release / discharge, for this purpose.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The rate of premium and Extended Insurance Benefits is reviewed and decided, based on actuarial calculation for the amount and period of cover. The amount of Insurance Cover and period of cover,
                        applicable to members, who are granted Extended Insurance Cover, is as mentioned in the Extended Insurance Certificate issued to each member at the time of their retirement / discharge. For persons who joined the scheme
                        wef 31 Jul 2010 to 31 Mar 2017 and wef 31 May 2022 onwards, the one-time subscription amount has been made refundable. The rate of premium and insurance amount applicable in respect of personnel becoming member of Extended
                        Insurance from the beginning of the scheme is given as under:
