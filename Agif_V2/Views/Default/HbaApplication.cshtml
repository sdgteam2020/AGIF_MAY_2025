                                            All ranks who are left with minimum five/two yrs of residual service (as the case may be) can avail a house loan from AGIF repayable over 20 yrs or upto 70 yrs of age with an understanding that balance of the remaining tenure of the loan would be taken over by Bank six months prior to his superannuation/PMR. The min service eligibility is 05 yrs of residual service for constr linked plan; however for outright purchase, it will be min residual service of 02 yrs only. This is a unique facility being extended to serving soldiers to help avail AGIF loan till retirement/PMR followed by taking over loan by PNB post retirement. The entire loan amount may be sanctioned by AGIF at its existing rate of interest and max amount in vogue as per norms of existing policy as on that day. The loan tenure would be split in two parts, one with AGIF till the individual release / premature retirement/ superannuation and the balance with PNB. The EMIs would be drawn on the collective tenure (AGIF + Bank) thus ensuing lower EMIs well within the repaying capacity of the loanee. The EMIs would be redrawn based on the Banks existing policies and rates of interests prevailing at the time of takeover.

                                            In the erstwhile Pre-EMI sys of recovery, loanees faced financial hardships due to delays in the PDC. To alleviate the said financial burden, and to stop levying of Pre-EMI, AGIF allowed ‘Old Cases’ (cases where the moratorium pd exceeded 3 yrs) to be frozen and EMI commenced on the amount disbursed. While this measure provided financial respite to loanees at the time, it left them without the reqd funds when possession of the DU was finally offered. AGIF will permit such loanees to apply for the unpaid instalments of the already sanctioned loan not disbursed to the member yet. The above will be subject to furnishing the self attested demand letter by the builder. The EMI will be reworked.
